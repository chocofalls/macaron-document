### MacaronSwap helps to the ecosystem with 2 ways:

### Trade and Earn.

# ↔️ Trade

> Instantly swap crypto tokens: no registration or account needed.

### Low fees

Trading fees are lower than other top decentralized exchanges. Who wants to pay more? MacaronSwap runs on Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain with much lower transaction costs than Ethereum or Bitcoin networks.

### Decentralized

Trade directly from your wallet app. Unlike centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, MacaronSwap doesn’t hold your funds when you trade; **you have 100% ownership of your own crypto**.

# 💸 Earn

> Earn MCRN and other tokens for free with sustainable interest rates.

### Earn tokens with Choco Falls

### Earn MCRN with Magic Box
