# FAQ

## Why MacaronSwap started on Binance Smart Chain (BSC)?

Network costs and speed which allows user maximize their earning loop. While BSC might not have the level of adoption Ethereum does at current, we believe in Binance’s ability and drive to get it mighty close in the foreseeable future.

## What will be the main differences from other projects?

The first difference of MacaronSwap will be emission rates and low inflation rates because of the reward/block ratio and circulating supply. Also, our team developed and deployed a multi-sender contract for low fees and being able to send tokens to 256 addresses at once. MacaronSwap will have an exchange, bridge, and a mobile app which will take place in Quarter 2, Quarter 3, and Quarter 4 of 2021.

## Is APY planned with low values on Falls and Magic Box?

We made voting on April 1, which proposes yearly calculations about block rewards, and EOY total supplies. You can see the voting here.
The community voted with their $MCRN’s and decided on Option 1. By the outcome of this, MacaronSwap hit 3M$ TVL in the first hour of opening. With the true APY on Falls and Magic Box, MacaronSwap aims at true emission rates (which is 0.2$MCRN/Block for the first year) and making circulation more efficient for users.

## What is the initial supply and total supply of $MCRN?

The initial supply of $MCRN was 1M. With the farming and staking rewards $MCRN will have a 3.102.400 total supply at the end of April 2022(without decreasing burned tokens, so expecting lower than 3.102.400.) You can see all the total supplies and rewards above with the EOY(end of year) estimations. 500K $MCRN sold on pre-sale and 100K $MCRN added to PancakeSwap for liquidity and belongs to the community life-long.

## What about the remaining 400K $MCRN?

The remaining 400k $MCRN separated as; 150K $MCRN for development purposes, 100K $MCRN for marketing, 100K $MCRN for the team, and the remaining 50K $MCRN for mobile app developments which we mentioned in our roadmap, 90% of the initial total supply was pertained to ecosystem and community.
All 400K $MCRN moved from hot wallets to cold wallets (can be seen in this tweets with txn’s which announced with [this](https://twitter.com/macaronswap/status/1374280797222494209) tweet.) Also, we made voting to get community approval for releasing a percentage of these funds. You can see all that proposals and results on our voting page which linked [here](https://vote.macaronswap.finance/#/).
