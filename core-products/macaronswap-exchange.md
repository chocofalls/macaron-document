# Exchange

[**Token swaps**](https://exchange.macaronswap.finance/#/swap) on MacaronSwap are a simple way to trade one BEP-20 token for another via automated liquidity pools.

The liquidity provided to the exchange comes from Liquidity Providers \("LPs"\) who stake their tokens in "Choco Falls". In exchange, they get LP \(MacaronSwap Liquidity Provider\) tokens, which can also be staked to earn MCRN tokens in the "Magic Box".

When you make a token swap \(trade\) on the exchange you will pay a **0.2% trading fee**, which is broken down as follows:

**0.17%** - Returned to liquidity pools in the form of a fee reward for liquidity providers.

**0.03%** - Sent to the PancakeSwap Treasury. After MacaronSwap deploys its own router, it will sent to MacaronSwap Treasury.
