# Choco Falls

**Choco Falls: yummy $MCRN!**

Choco Falls allows BSC projects to bootstrap adoption by distributing a portion of their tokens to CHOCO token holders.

Choco Falls will be split into two sections: Core and Community.

- Core will be initially selected by the MacaronSwap team.
- Community will be projects that pass a community vote on the governance portal.

Note that any project will be able to distribute tokens via Choco Falls but only projects that win a vote would be listed on the swap interface as a default option \(in order to discourage scams\).

**Why would projects want to participate?**

Choco Falls projects will allow projects to receive market attention by issuing tokens to the reputable community.

Projects will also receive an immediate default listing on the MacaronSwap interface, obtaining priority promotion on the exchange \(by ranking temporarily first in selecting tokens on the website\).
