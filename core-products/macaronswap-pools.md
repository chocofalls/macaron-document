# Pools

\*\*\*\*[**MacaronSwap Magic Box** ](https://exchange.macaronswap.finance/#/pool)allow you to provide liquidity by adding your tokens to liquidity pools or “LPs”.

When you add your token to a liquidity pool \(LP\), you will receive LP tokens.

As an example, if you deposited $MCRN and $BNB into a liquidity pool, you would receive MCRN-BNB LP tokens.

The number of LP tokens you receive represents your portion of the MCRN-BNB liquidity pool. You can also redeem your funds at any time by removing your liquidity.

Providing liquidity is not without risk, as you may be exposed to impermanent loss.

It’s not all bad for liquidity providers as you will also be given a reward in the form of trading fees. Whenever someone trades MacaronSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on.

For example:

- There are 10 LO tokens representing 10 MCRN and 10 BNB tokens.
- 1 LP token = 1 MCRN + 1 BNB
- Someone trades 10 MCRN for 10 BNB.
- Someone else trades 10 BNB for 10 MCRN.
- The MCRN/BNB liquidity pool now has 10.017 MCRN and 10.017 BNB.
- Each LP token is now worth 1.00017 MCRN + 1.00017 BNB.

To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the [MCRN farms \(here\)](https://macaronswap.finance/), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
